1) HDFS : HDFS (Hadoop Distributed Filesystem) is a distributed, scalable, and portable file system written in Java for the Hadoop framework which helps to store large files across multiple machines.

2) HBase : HBase is an open source, non-relational, distributed database  developed as part of Apache Software Foundation's Apache Hadoop project and runs on top of HDFS, providing BigTable-like capabilities for Hadoop.

3) Zookeeper : Apache ZooKeeper is a top-level project of Hadoop and provides an open source distributed configuration service,synchronization service,and naming registry for large distributed systems.

4) Chukwa : Chukwa is a Hadoop subproject built on top of the Hadoop distributed filesystem (HDFS),MapReduce Framework and it is devoted to large-scale log collection and analysis.

5) Scribe : Scribe is an open source log-aggregator which can be integrated with hadoop to allow the write-load to be distributed among a bunch of commodity machines which enables to capture weblogs in low cost. 

6) Mahout : Apache Mahout is to build a vibrant, responsive, diverse community to facilitate discussions not only on the project itself but also on potential use cases and its  core algorithms for clustering, classification and batch based collaborative filtering are implemented on top of Apache Hadoop using the map/reduce paradigm  

7) Cassandra : Cassandra supports running Hadoop MapReduce jobs against the Cassandra cluster i.e. in a properly configured cluster, MapReduce jobs can retrieve data from Cassandra and then output results either back into Cassandra, or into a file system.

8) Dumbo : Dumbo is a project that allows you to easily write and run Hadoop programs in Python. 

9) Spark : Apache Spark is an open-source data analytics cluster computing framework that provides an easier to use alternative to Hadoop MapReduce and offers performance up to 100 times faster than previous generation systems like Hadoop MapReduce for certain applications.


10) Sqoop : Apache Sqoop(TM) is a tool designed for efficiently transferring bulk data between Apache Hadoop and structured datastores such as relational databases.

11) Jaql : Jaql is a JSON (Java Script Object Notation) query language which provides  parallelism for hadoop by rewriting  high-level queries, when appropriate, into “low-level” queries consisting of MapReduce jobs. 

12) Oozie : Oozie is a workflow scheduler system to manage Apache Hadoop jobs.

13) Giraph : Apache Giraph is an iterative graph processing system inspired by Google's Pregel paper written in 2010 and Apache Hadoop is an open source implementation of Google’s MapReduce paper written in 2004.. 

14) Hcatlog : HCatalog is a set of interfaces that open up access to Hive's metastore for tools inside and outside of the Hadoop grid.

15) Fuse-DS : The hadoop-hdfs-fuse(file system in userinterface) package enables you to use your HDFS cluster as if it were a traditional filesystem on Linux.
